# watson.nvim

An integration for [Watson](https://tailordev.github.io/Watson/) in
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

## Commands

**Status:**
```
:WatsonStatus
```

## Ideas

At first only basic commands will be available. e.g., status, start, stop,
restart.

More complete concept is something comparable to vim-fugitive's summary
feature. Meaning a buffer opens with the current status and some other useful
details along with predefined remaps for managing Watson.
